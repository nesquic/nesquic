    was originally the same word as Chingo (親舊), 
    <br>and was a Chinese character meaning 'relatives and friends'. 
    <br><u>Chin (親)</u> means relative, and <u>Gu (舊)</u> means <strong>'old friend'</strong>. 
    <br>However, in Korea, the meaning of relative was lost and it was used limitedly to the meaning of 'friend'. 
    <br>distinguished from acquaintances. Until the Korean War, it was only used by middle-aged and older people.
